## Considerations
When you prepare a smoke test, consider the following:

- Each time you create or update a script, run a smoke test

  Because smoke tests verify test scripts, try to run one every time you create or update a script. Avoid running other test types with untested scripts.

- Keep throughput small and duration short

  Configure your test script to be executed by a small number of VUs (from 2 to 20) with few iterations or brief durations (30 seconds to 3 minutes).

## Results analysis
The smoke test initially validates that your script runs without errors. If any script-related errors appear, correct the script before trying any more extensive tests.

On the other hand, if you notice poor performance with these low VU numbers, report it, fix your environment, and try again with a smoke test before any further tests.

Once your smoke test shows zero errors and the performance results seem acceptable, you can proceed to other test types.

## How to run test:

- `k6 run project/tests/api/02.smoke.js`

- `k6 run project/tests/api/02.smoke.js --out cloud`

- `k6 cloud project/tests/api/02.smoke.js`

- `K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true K6_WEB_DASHBOARD_EXPORT=project/results/smoke/02.html-report.html k6 run project/tests/api/02.smoke.js`

- `k6 run  project/tests/api/02.smoke.js --out csv=project/results/smoke/02.smoke-results.csv`
