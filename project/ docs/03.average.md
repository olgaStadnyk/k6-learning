# Average Load Test

This scenario simulates the user workload during a typical hour in production. 
The scenario includes the most frequently executed requests or functionalities within that hour.

This test scenario typically includes ramp-up and ramp-down periods to simulate users gradually logging in and interacting with the system. The load test gradually increases the number of VUs until it reaches the desired load to mimic the average load behavior in production.

Between the ramp-up and ramp-down periods is a steady state, a period when the number of virtual users is constant. In an average load test, the test sustains the steady-state load simulation for an hour or so.
