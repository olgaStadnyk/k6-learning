# Stress testing

Stress testing assesses how the system performs when loads are heavier than usual.

The load pattern of a stress test resembles that of an average-load test. The main difference is higher load. To account for higher load, the ramp-up period takes longer in proportion to the load increase. Similarly, after the test reaches the desired load, it might last for slightly longer than it would in the average-load test.

# Soak testing

Soak testing is another variation of the Average-Load test. It focuses on extended periods, analyzing the following:

The system’s degradation of performance and resource consumption over extended periods.
The system’s availability and stability during extended periods.
The soak test differs from an average-load test in test duration. In a soak test, the peak load duration (usually an average amount) extends several hours and even days. Though the duration is considerably longer, the ramp-up and ramp-down periods of a soak test are the same as an average-load test.
