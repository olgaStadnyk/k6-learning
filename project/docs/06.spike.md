# Spike test

A spike test verifies whether the system survives and performs under sudden and massive rushes of utilization.

Spike tests are useful when the system may experience events of sudden and massive traffic.

Spike testing increases to extremely high loads in a very short or non-existent ramp-up time. Usually, it has no plateau period or is very brief, as real users generally do not stick around doing extra steps in these situations. In the same way, the ramp-down is very fast or non-existent, letting the process iterate only once.

This test might include different processes than the previous test types, as spikes often arenâ€™t part of an average day in production. It may also require adding, removing, or modifying processes on the script that were not in the average-load tests.
