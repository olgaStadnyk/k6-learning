// Request to Gemini: create the load test with the jsonplaceholder.typicode.com api k6

// Response:
// Here's a k6 script for load testing the JSONPlaceholder API:

import http from 'k6/http';

// Define the base URL for the API
const baseUrl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com';

export default function() {
  // Choose an endpoint to test (modify as needed)
  const endpoint = '/posts';

  // Send a GET request to the chosen endpoint
  http.get(baseUrl + endpoint);
}

// Configure the load test
export const options = {
    // Run the test for 30 seconds with 10 virtual users (VUs)
    duration: '30s', 
    vus: 10,
};

/*
Explanation:

Import: We import the http module from k6 for making HTTP requests.
Base URL: Define the base URL for the JSONPlaceholder API.
Default Function: This function defines the actual test scenario.
Endpoint: Choose the endpoint you want to test. Here, it's set to /posts, but you can modify it to target other endpoints like /users or /comments.
GET Request: Use http.get to send a GET request to the chosen endpoint URL.
Options: This object configures the load test.
Durations: This defines the test duration and virtual users (VUs). Here, it runs for 30 seconds with 10 VUs, simulating 10 concurrent users hitting the API. You can adjust these values based on your needs.
Running the Test:

Save the script as a .js file (e.g., test.js).
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the test using the k6 command:

k6 run test.js

This will execute the test and display performance metrics like response times and throughput.

Additional Notes:

You can add more complex scenarios like sending POST requests with data or looping through different endpoints.
Consider using thresholds in the options object to define acceptable response times or error rates. Refer to the k6 documentation for advanced configuration options: https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/
